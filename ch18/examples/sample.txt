Here's a story,of a lovely lady
who was bringing up very lovely girls
all of them had hair of gold like their mother.
the youngest one in curls.

Here's a story, of a man named Brady
Who was busy with 3 boys of his own.
They were 4 men living all together
yet they were all alone

Till one day when the lady met this fellow.
And they knew it was much more than a hunch,
That this group must somehow form a family,
That's the way they became the Brady bunch.

The Brady bunch, the Brady bunch.
That's the way they became the Brady bunch.
